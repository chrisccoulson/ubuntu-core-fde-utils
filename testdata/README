- eventlog1.bin is an event log from a QEMU instance running OVMF with the following configuration:
  - "Ubuntu OVMF Secure Boot (PK/KEK key)" enrolled in to PK.
  - "Ubuntu OVMF Secure Boot (PK/KEK key)", "Microsoft Corporation KEK CA 2011" and test certificate enrolled in to
    KEK.
  - UEFI database and forbidden signature database from efivars1/.
  - Booted with a version of shim signed by the test UEFI CA key, Grub signed by Canonical's archive key (the
    issuer of which is shim's embedded vendor cert) and a custom kernel signed by the test UEFI CA key.
- eventlog2.bin is an event log from the same QEMU instance but with with secure boot validation disabled in shim
  via MokSBState.
