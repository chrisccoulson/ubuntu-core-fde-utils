- db1.bin is the UEFI database from a Dell Precision Workstation 7510, containing the 2 Microsoft CAs.
- dbx1.bin is the UEFI forbidden signature database from the same machine, with MS-2016-08-08.bin applied.
- db2.bin is the UEFI database from a QEMU instance running OVMF with "Microsoft Windows Production PCA 2011", "Microsoft Corporation UEFI CA 2011" and a test CA certificate enrolled.
- db3.bin is the same as db2.bin with a second test CA certificate enrolled.
- dbx2.in is the UEFI forbidden signature database from the same QEMU instance.

- eventlog1.bin is an event log from a QEMU instance running OVMF with the following configuration:
  - "Ubuntu OVMF Secure Boot (PK/KEK key)" enrolled in to PK.
  - "Ubuntu OVMF Secure Boot (PK/KEK key)", "Microsoft Corporation KEK CA 2011" and test certificate enrolled in to
    KEK.
  - "Microsoft Windows Production PCA 2011", "Microsoft Corporation UEFI CA 2011" and test CA certificate enrolled
    in to db (db2.bin).
  - Booted with a version of shim signed by the test UEFI CA key, Grub signed by Canonical's archive key (the
    issuer of which is shim's embedded vendor cert) and a custom kernel signed by the test UEFI CA key.
- eventlog2.bin is an event log from the same QEMU instance but with with secure boot validation disabled in shim
  via MokSBState.

  second test CA in db3.bin.

- mockshim1.efi.signed.1 is a mock shim EFI executable signed with the key from a certificate issued by the test
  CA in db2.bin, and the same test CA certificate embedded as the vendor cert.
- mockshim1.efi.signed.2 is the same as mockshim1.efi.signed.1 but signed with the key from a certificate issued
  by the second test CA in db3.bin.
- mockshim2.efi.signed.1 is a mock shim EFI executable signed with the key from a certificate issued by the test CA
  in db2.bin, and the second test CA certificate from db3.bin embedded as the vendor cert.
